 Welcome, I am Leah 👋

## 👩‍💻 About Me:

I am a newly trained Data Scientist and currently looking for work.

I have a broad science and research background. Ranging from zoology 🐅 and environmental conservation 🌱 to microbiology 🔬.

💻 I am currently working on improving my skills from my data camp and working on a Satellite Image Classification project with Aggregate Intellect.

⚡ Fun Fact: I did field work during my master's and got electrocuted 3 times in less than 2 weeks.
